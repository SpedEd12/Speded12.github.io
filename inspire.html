        <h2>How does he Inspire?</h2>
        <p>Growing up you've probably hear of Muhammad Ali, or perhaps you've heard his speech where he states: "I'll show you how great I am".</p>
        <p>To many people this guy may sounds cocky or overcoinfident, but he has proved time after time that he has the skills to back his talk.</p> 
        <p>As a fellow athlete watching someone rise to the title of "The Greatest" is something that just pulls your heart strings. Something that lights a fire inside of you.</p>
        <p>It is something that makes you want to push harder at practice even when you feel like you can't. It's the desire to be as great as him that makes him inspirational to me.</p>
